# Algorithm-Complexity-Analysis
Algorithms lab first assignment, 25.03.2023

This assignment as the title suggests was all about implementing different sorting and selection algorithms
and comparing their complexities with each other.

We have implemented selection, quick and bucket sort, also linear search and binary search. Then we've ran our implementations 
with the given dataset using different input sizes each time, and plotted the results using XChart. 
You can find my implementations and observations in the report.
